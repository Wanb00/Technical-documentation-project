          <p><li>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. </li></p>

          <p><li>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library. </li></p>

          <p><li>Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[35] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2. </li></p>

          <p><li>Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and has gained widespread use in the machine learning community. </li>
        </ul></p>

        <p class="basics">Basic terminology to learn and encounter:</p>
        <ul class="basic-list">
          <p><li>Variables
            <code>e.g., variable = 5</code>  
          </li></p>
          <p><li>For loops</li>
          <code> for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
                      {
                        variable += array[i]
                      } 
          </code><br>
          This would loop over an array whilst adding each index into a new variable.</p>
          <p><li>If, elif and else statements </li>
            <code> if x = true: return false; else return true} </code><br>
            If variable x is a value of true then it would return a value of false to the console or else it returns true.
           </p>
          <p><li>While loops</li>
          <code>while x < 10: x + 2 return x</code><br>
            This will loop over as long as x is less than 10 then adds 2 to x each time and returns the x value to the console.
          </p>
          <p><li>Functions and calls</li>
          <code>def addNumbers(num1, num2):
            x = num1 + num2;
            return x; 
            addNumbers(5, 10);</code><br>
            This would define the function "addNumbers" with 2 parameters of num1 and num2 where it adds the two numbers into a new variable x and returns it. Afterwards you call the function inputting 2 parameters for it to execute.
          </p>

        <header><h1>Python name</h1></header>
        <p class="name">Python's name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture;[190] for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar.[190][191] The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines.[192][193] Users of Python are sometimes referred to as "Pythonistas".[194]</p>

<p class="name">The prefix Py- is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include Pygame, a binding of Simple DirectMedia Layer to Python (commonly used to create games); PyQt and PyGTK, which bind Qt and GTK to Python respectively; and PyPy, a Python implementation originally written in Python. </p>
